# SudokuSolver
This repository is where I put all of the scripts I have for solving and creating sudokus.

Currently there is only one script, sudoku_solver.py, which can be used to solve sudokus of 4x4, 9x9, 25x25, etc.
Be aware that sudokus that require a lot of backtracing (a sort of directed brute force method) instead of traditional sudoku solving methods, can take a long time.
