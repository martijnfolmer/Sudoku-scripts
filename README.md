# SudokuSolver
This repository is where I put all of the scripts I have for solving and creating sudokus.

Currently there is only one script, sudoku_solver.py, which can be used to solve sudokus of 4x4, 9x9, 25x25, etc.

In order to use the script, you have to manually input the sudoku at the bottom of the script (after __ __name__ __='__ __main__ __'). Further down are some examples of sudoku's, which you can solve by replacing the sudoku in __ __name__ __='__ __main__ __' with them.

Be aware that sudokus that require a lot of backtracing (a sort of directed brute force method) instead of traditional sudoku solving methods, can take a long time.
